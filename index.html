                            <p>Modern, yacht-inspired aesthetic and clever cabin technology make for more than just a
                                space to live (or sleep). The cabins and suites are a hero experience, a signature
                                moment, places to escape and retreat from the world; that sweet moment of exhale. They
                                are...cozy, stylish, modern and smart. This is sailing the Virgin way.</p>
                            <p><b>Letâs talk Quarters. (Suites)</b></p>
                            <p>RockStar Quarters are where superyachts meet luxury cruises along with rock and roll
                                royalty. Accents of brass and slabs of marble guide you to spacious stargazing terraces,
                                and every detail of these suites serves to celebrate the romance of the open ocean. The
                                suites were conceptualized by world-renowned designer, Tom Dixon - describing Grace
                                Jones as the muse for these gorgeous suites.</p>
                            <p><b>Richard's Rooftop</b></p>
                            <p>Booking a suite unlocks access to Richard's Rooftop; an exclusive sun deck where elegance
                                meets exuberance. A lavish, elaborate and members-only outdoor space for RockStar
                                Quarters Sailors to bask under the sun or have a drink under the stars. Think VIP
                                Rockstar service, chilled vibes, cool tunes, sophisticated loungers and being surrounded
                                by dichroic glass casting stunning rainbow reflections through the rooftop.</p>
                            <p><b>Let's talk Cabins.</b></p>
                            <p>The ultimate go-to for rejuvenation, the cabins stand out for their flexible furnishings,
                                upgraded bathrooms with Roomy Rainshowers and sensory mood lighting, creating comfy
                                quarters that are way more than just a place to crash. The Lady Ships offer the most
                                lavish, and unique, beds at sea. The Seabed re-imagines the cruise cabin experience.
                                Your cabin, your way. The cabins are custom-created to accommodate the Seabed, the
                                first-ever transformational cabin bed at sea. Award-winning Walter Knoll, whoâs designed
                                thoughtful and sustainable furniture for over 150 years, is responsible for specially
                                engineering and handcrafting our transformative Seabed in Germany. Sailors can enjoy
                                their cabin in two distinct ways, as a place to revel or a place to relax. A luxurious
                                loungey space transforms into an expansive bedroom with a queen size bed in one swift
                                movement. The transformation can be executed by the sailor or by one of our crew. </p>

                                        <p>Relaxing is truly an art form in this suite. The terrace hammock here is the
                                            perfect spot to enjoy a nightcap while watching the moon flirt with the sea.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Once inside, Sailors can lose themselves in the massive European king bed
                                            while drifting off to the sounds of the waves (or the vinyl record player).

                                        <p>Complemented perfectly by brass nautical finishings throughout, thereâs also
                                            a fully stocked, in-room bar, an indoor Peek-a-Boo shower with an iridescent
                                            dichroic glass window for a peek into the room and an outdoor Peek-a-View
                                            shower facing the sea, near the terrace Champagne tableâ and sun lounger.
                                            Sleeps up to four. </p>

                                most popular holiday spots. It has so much to offer; from its countless beach areas, to
                                culture and museums, from spa and shopping days out, to endless cuban restaurants and
                                cafes. Miami is a multicultural city that has something to offer to everyone. </div>
                            <div><br /><b><u>Mexico - Cozumel</u></b><br />It's not another CancÃºn yet, but Cozumel's
                                days as a rustic divers' hangout are history. Whether arriving by plane or at the
                                island's gleaming ferry terminal, visitors soon realize there's nothing deserted about
                                this island. That has its advantages. It's rare to find such stunning natural beauty,
                                glass-clear aquamarine seas, and vast marine life combined with top-flight visitor
                                services and accommodations, and as a result Cozumel's devotees are legion. Divers
                                sharing stories of lionfish and sharks sit table-to-table with families tanned from a
                                day at the beach club, while Mexican couples spin and step to salsa music in the central
                                plaza. But the elephant in Cozumel's big and bountiful room are the throngs of
                                cruise-ship passengers who take over the countless crafts and jewelry stores along the
                                seaward boulevard downtown any day there are ships in portâwhich is to say, just about
                                every day. But take just a few steps off the beaten path and this little island offers
                                big rewards. Deserted, windswept beaches, wild and vibrant natural parks, and 600 miles
                                of coral reef are still yours for the discovering. Just 19 km (12 miles) off the coast,
                                Cozumel is 53 km (33 miles) long and 15 km (9 miles) wide, making it the country's
                                third-largest island. Plaza Central, or just "la plaza," is the heart of San Miguel,
                                directly across from the docks. Residents congregate here in the evening, especially on
                                weekends, when free concerts begin at 8 pm. Heading inland (east) takes you away from
                                the tourist zone and toward residential areas of town. Most of the island's restaurants,
                                hotels, stores, and dive shops are concentrated downtown and along the two hotel zones
                                that fan out along the leeward coast to the north and south of San Miguel. The most
                                concentrated commercial district is between Calle 10 Norte and Calle 11 Sur to beyond
                                Avenida Pedro Joaquin Coldwell. Cozumel's solitude-seeking windward side also has a few
                                restaurants and one hotel. Unless you want to stick around your hotel or downtown San
                                Miguel for your whole stay, you'll do well to rent a car or a scooter. Most worthwhile
                                sites, such as the island's Mayan ruins and pristine windward beaches, are only readily
                                accessible with wheels. Taxi fares are astronomical, and after just a few trips a rental
                                car is clearly a better deal.</div>
                            <div><br /><b><u>Bahamas - Bimini Island</u></b><br />The lovely little dual islands of
                                Bimini consists of two main islandsâNorth Bimini Island and South Bimini Islandâ as well
                                as countless cays. Located just 50 miles off Floridaâs coast, Bimini is the closest
                                Bahamian island to the United States, and as such is the most âAmericanâ if all the
                                Bahamian Islands. Yet, the miles and miles of pristine beaches are witness to the fact
                                that yes, this is the Bahamas and yes, this is paradise indeed.</div>
